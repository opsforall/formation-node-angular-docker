# Deploy Angular and Nodejs apps using docker-compose and expose them using Nginx and Certbot to configure HTTPS

This project contains a Step-by-step guide of the live workshop "How to deploy Angular and nodejs apps in an EC2 instance, expose microservices using Nginx and configure HTTPS using Certbot"




## ðŸš€ Step-by-step Deployment Guide
### 1. let's code using Copilot and run the project

1.1 Open the project in VS Code

1.2 We're going to add some config in the backend and the frontend project

1.2.1 Open the backend repo and go to database.js that located under ./backend/src/database/database.js of the root project

1.2.2 Open Copilot and type this prompt that will help us to put a dynamic config of the database connexion
```bash
  Hey, I want to replace the database config dynamically from env variables that were configured in docker-compose.yml
  PS: I don't have any .env file in the project
```

In case you got lost wit Copilot output just replace the vaule of sequelize with : 

```bash
export const sequelize = new Sequelize(
  process.env.APP_DB_NAME 
  process.env.APP_DB_USER 
  process.env.APP_DB_PASS 
  {
    host: process.env.DB_HOST 
    dialect: process.env.DB_DIALECT 
  }
);
```
and go to docker-compose.yml file in the root folder and add this block to the backend service:
 
```bash
    environment:
      - APP_DB_NAME=my_database
      - APP_DB_USER=my_user
      - APP_DB_PASS=my_password
      - DB_HOST=db
      - DB_DIALECT=postgres
```

1.2.3 Apply the suggested solution to database.js and docker-compose.yml

1.2.4 Run these commands
```bash
  # Login to docker registry
  docker login
  
  # Access the backend repo
  cd backend
  docker build -t karimarous/backend:1.0.0 .
  docker push karimarous/backend:1.0.0
  cd ..
  docker-compose up -d
```       

1.3.1 Open the frontend repo and go to proxy.conf.json that located under ./frontend/proxy.conf.json of the root project

1.3.2 We will use the same concepts to configure the backend URL

Just replace the vaule of the target with : "${API_TARGET}"  and go to docker-compose.yml file in the root folder and add this block to the frontend service:
 
```bash
    environment:
      - API_TARGET=http://backend:3000
```

1.3.3 Apply the suggested solution to proxy.conf.json and docker-compose.yml

1.3.4 Run these commands
```bash
  # Login to docker registry
  docker login
  
  # Access the backend repo
  cd frontend
  docker build -t karimarous/frontend:1.0.0 .
  docker push karimarous/frontend:1.0.0
  cd ..
  docker-compose up -d
```  

### 2. Deploy the applications in an EC2 instance
2.1 You need to access the EC2 instance and install the following packages 

```bash
sudo su
apt update -y
apt upgrade -y
apt install -y python3-certbot-nginx docker.io
curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

#you can use these commands to verify the version used
docker version
docker-compose version
nginx -version
certbot --version

# Deploy the backend and frontend apps
git clone https://github.com/opsforall/formation-node-angular-docker.git
cd formation-node-angular-docker
docker-compose up -d
```

2.2 Configure nginx and Certbot 

2.2.1 Configure DNS provider

In this workshop, we used Namescheap as domain name provider

You need to buy your own domain

2.2.2 Create records

We need to go the domain purchased and click on Advanced DNS. Then we need to create 2 records one for backend and one for the frontend microservices. Ensure to put the pulic IP of the EC2 instance in the value section of each records

2.2.3 Configure Nginx reverse proxy

2.2.3.1 For backend

You need to copy the following code inside /etc/nginx/sites-available/backend.domainpurchased
```bash
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name backend.domainpurchased;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://publicip:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

Run the following commands
```bash
ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/backend.domainpurchased /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
# test and implement nginx Config
nginx -t
systemctl reload nginx
```

2.2.3.2 For frontend

You need to copy the following code inside /etc/nginx/sites-available/frontend.domainpurchased
```bash
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name frontend.domainpurchased;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://publicip:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

Run the following commands
```bash
ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/frontend.domainpurchased /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
# test and implement nginx Config
nginx -t
systemctl reload nginx
```

2.2.4 Configure HTTPS using Certbot

```bash
certbot --nginx -d frontend.domainpurchased
certbot --nginx -d backend.domainpurchased

# renew certificates if necessary
certbot renew
```
